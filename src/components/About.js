                        The implementation of UI involves breaking the UI into several reuseable components and implementing concepts of hooks, states, passing props to components, navigating between various components from navBar as well as from within different components, and use of React lifecycle components, which are implemeted in this project using useEffect() in functional based components. The components states are getting updated based on either user inputs or the live data fetched from the database.
